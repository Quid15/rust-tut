# Rust Tutorial 

This repository is built around my journey of learning **Rust** â€” my very first programming language ðŸ˜¶.  

At the beginning, I was honestly dubious about whether picking Rust as my first language was the right move. And I should tell you all, not everyone was thrilled when I said that out loud. Some think I am being reckless, maybe even crazy, for skipping the "beginner-friendly" languages and diving head-first into Rust.  

But here I am. This repo is a collection of memories what I learn, break, fix, and understand along the way. If youâ€™re curious about Rust (or just want to see someone(me) struggle and figure things out), then you might find this helpful.
